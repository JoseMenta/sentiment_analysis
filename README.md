# Sentiment Analysis

The following project implements various neural networks with the purpose of distinguishing the tone of a review as eigther positive or negative. 

## Running the project

### Using google colab
The easiest and recommended way to run the Jupyter notebooks is to use [Google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), as it provides the compute resources in an environment where the required dependencies are already installed. 

To use it:
1. Import the notebook in a new project
2. Connect to a compute resource
3. Run all the code cells

To run the code in _get\_reviews.py_, the contents of the file can be copied inside a code cell in the notebook where the csv file with the reviews is needed. 

### Without google colab
Alternatively, the project can be run using a local environment. This environment should run [Python 3.12.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3125/) or higher and have the dependencies specified in the file _requirements.txt_, which can be installed using a package manager like [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) with the following command.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
For further information on how to run the notebooks, [this link](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks) provides information to set it on Visual Studio Code or [this link](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/jupyter-notebook-support.html#-h1z4uh_2) for Pycharm. Also, the Jypyter site provides [a page](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/running.html) to start a custom notebook server.
